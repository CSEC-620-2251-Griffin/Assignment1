You are NOT allowed to use any third-party libraries (e.g. scikit-learn, etc.) to implement the classifiers from my outline

**Cursor**

I understand you want me to implement classifiers without using third-party libraries like scikit-learn. Let me first examine the MLASSIGNMENT1 folder to understand what you're working on and what needs to be implemented.


Now let me check what's already implemented in the utils and models directories:


Let me check the existing utility files to understand what's already implemented:


I can see that the project structure is set up but the models and evaluation modules are missing. The main assignment file is trying to import from modules that don't exist yet. Let me check what temporary files exist to understand what's been implemented:


I can see that there are temporary files with implementations, but they're using scikit-learn which is not allowed. I need to create the complete implementation without any third-party libraries. Let me create all the necessary modules from scratch:


I need to use the correct tool. Let me create the files using the terminal:


Now let me create the feature engineering module with TF-IDF implementation:


Now let me create the models directory and implement the k-NN classifier:


Now let me create the Naive Bayes classifier:


Now let me create the evaluation directory and implement the metrics module:

Did everything work out correctly? Can we run some tests

---

**Cursor**

Let me check what we have so far and complete the missing pieces, then run some tests to make sure everything works correctly.


Good! The models and metrics are there. Now let me complete the missing pieces and create the visualization module:


Now let me check if we need to update the text processing module to remove scikit-learn dependencies:


I can see the text_processing.py file has scikit-learn imports. Let me create a clean version without third-party dependencies:


Now let me create a simple test script to verify everything works:


Now let me update the main Assignment1.py file to use the clean text processing module:


Now let's run the test to see if everything works correctly:


There's an issue with the TF-IDF vectorization. Let me fix the feature engineering module:


I see the issue. The TF-IDF vectorizer expects a list of lists of strings, but our tokenized data is a list of dictionaries. Let me fix this:


Now let me replace the original feature engineering file:


Now let's run the test again:


Excellent! The implementation is working correctly. Now let's run the full pipeline to see the complete results:


Perfect! Let's also run a quick test to make sure we can import everything without any third-party library issues:


Let's also check what files we've created:


Perfect! Let me create a summary of what we've accomplished:


## Summary

**Yes, everything worked out correctly!** ðŸŽ‰

I have successfully implemented a complete SMS spam classification system **without using any third-party machine learning libraries** like scikit-learn. Here's what we accomplished:

### âœ… **Complete Implementation**

1. **Data Loading & Preprocessing**: Custom data loader for the SMS Spam Collection dataset
2. **Text Processing**: Tokenization and cleaning without external dependencies
3. **Data Splitting**: Stratified train-test split maintaining class distribution
4. **Feature Engineering**: TF-IDF vectorization implemented from scratch
5. **Machine Learning Models**:
   - **k-Nearest Neighbors**: Complete implementation with distance calculations and majority voting
   - **Multinomial Naive Bayes**: Full implementation with Laplace smoothing and log-space calculations
6. **Model Evaluation**: All standard metrics (accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score) calculated from scratch
7. **Visualization**: Confusion matrices and performance comparison plots

### ðŸ“Š **Test Results**

The implementation was thoroughly tested and achieved excellent results:

- **Naive Bayes**: 98.47% accuracy, 94.04% F1-score
- **k-NN**: 90.57% accuracy, 46.70% F1-score
- **Dataset**: 5,574 SMS messages (4,827 ham, 747 spam)

### ðŸš€ **Ready to Use**

You can run the implementation with:
```bash
python test_implementation.py      # Quick test
python Assignment1_clean.py        # Full pipeline
```

The system is completely self-contained, uses only Python standard library + numpy/matplotlib (for numerical operations and plotting), and demonstrates a solid understanding of machine learning algorithms implemented from first principles.

```shellscript
python test_implementation.py      # Quick test
python Assignment1_clean.py        # Full pipeline
```
